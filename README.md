# College Evaluation System (CITE-ES)

A full-stack college evaluation management system built with **Next.js 14 (App Router)**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **MySQL**.

## Features

- **Multi-role system** — Dean, Teacher, and Student dashboards with role-based access
- **Academic period management** — Semesters with automatic transition handling (cascade close/lock)
- **Evaluation periods** — Draft → Active → Closed lifecycle with date-enforced submission windows
- **Multi-group evaluation setup** — Assign multiple programs/year levels per evaluation period
- **Dynamic evaluation forms** — JSON-based criteria and questions (student-to-teacher & peer-review)
- **Peer-to-peer evaluations** — Pairwise teacher evaluations with anonymous results
- **Ghost evaluations** — Dean can submit anonymous evaluations that blend into regular results
- **Just-in-time sync** — Late registrants automatically receive evaluation assignments on dashboard load
- **Real-time analytics** — Per-teacher performance trends, criteria breakdowns, top instructors
- **Anonymous feedback** — Student/peer comments displayed without author identity

## Quick Start

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment
Create `.env.local`:
```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_NAME=cite_es
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_here
```

### 3. Set up database
Requires MySQL (XAMPP recommended).
```bash
npm run db:init       # Creates tables + seeds sample data
```

### 4. Start dev server
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open **http://localhost:3000**

### Test credentials
| Role | Email | Password |

## Key Workflows

### Evaluation lifecycle
1. Dean creates an **Academic Period** (semester)
2. Dean creates an **Evaluation Period** with a form, date range, and assignment groups
3. Dean clicks **Start Evaluation** → bulk generates evaluation records for matching students/teachers
4. Students/teachers fill out evaluations within the date window
5. Dean monitors progress, can ghost-evaluate, lock/unlock, or reset evaluations
6. Dean activates a new academic period → old evaluations auto-close and lock

### Late registrant handling
When a student or teacher visits their dashboard, `POST /api/evaluations/sync` runs automatically, creating any missing evaluation assignments based on their program/year/section.

## Troubleshooting

### "Too many connections" in phpMyAdmin
Next.js hot reloading creates new DB pools on each file save. The pool is cached on `globalThis` to prevent this, but if it happens:
1. Restart MySQL in XAMPP
2. Restart dev server

### Port 3000 busy
Next.js auto-switches to the next available port.

### Stale dev lock
```bash
rm -rf .next/dev/lock
```
