## File Ownership

Files are loosely mapped to slices. If you need to touch a file outside your slice, **log it in the Communication Log** so other agents know — don't wait for permission, just communicate.

### Slice File Map

| Slice | Primary Files |
|-------|---------------|
| Pre-slice (Data Fix) | `database/schema.sql`, `app/api/courses/route.ts`, `tools/seed.js` |
| Slice 1 (Admin Setup) | `app/dean/evaluation-setup/page.tsx`, `app/dean/dashboard/page.tsx` |
| Slice 2 (Student Flow) | `app/student/evaluations/page.tsx`, `app/student/dashboard/page.tsx`, `app/student/history/page.tsx` |
| Slice 3 (Teacher Flow) | `app/teacher/dashboard/page.tsx`, `app/teacher/peer/page.tsx`, `app/teacher/results/page.tsx` |

### Shared Files — Coordinate Before Changing

These files are used across slices. You can edit them if needed, but **log what you changed and why** so other agents don't get surprised.

- `lib/db.ts` — DB connection pool. Stable, unlikely to need changes.
- `hooks/index.ts` — `useFetch` hook. Stable, unlikely to need changes.
- `app/api/*` — API routes. Can be modified to fix bugs or add fields — log changes.
- `components/ui/*` — UI component library. Add new components if needed, log them.
- `database/schema.sql` — Schema definition. Can be updated when the live DB schema changes — keep it aligned with `cite_es.sql`.

### claude-opus — 2026-03-17
**To**: All
**Topic**: Pre-slice data consolidation + Slice 1 complete

**Pre-slice (Data Fix):**
- `database/schema.sql` — Aligned `courses` table with `cite_es.sql` (INT ids, `teacher_id` instead of `instructor_id`, added `course_program`/`year_level` columns). Aligned `course_enrollments` similarly.
- `app/api/courses/route.ts` — Fixed student query: `instructor_id` → `teacher_id`. Added `course_program`/`year_level` to dean query and response formatter. Fixed bug where course name was used as fallback for instructor name.
- `tools/seed.js` — Added ALTER TABLE to ensure `course_program`/`year_level` columns exist, updated course INSERTs with program and year data.
- Deleted dead files: `database/subjects.sql` (never imported), `app/api/subjects/route.ts` (queried non-existent table), `tools/import_sql.js` (referenced non-existent file).

**Slice 1 (Admin Eval Setup):**
- `app/dean/evaluation-setup/page.tsx` — Removed stray JSX block (build error). Replaced hardcoded instructor list with `useFetch('/users')` filtered to teachers. Replaced hardcoded subjects with `useFetch('/courses')` filtered by program/year/semester. Wired `saveSetup()` to POST `/api/forms` + POST `/api/evaluation_periods`. Wired `startEvaluation()` to PATCH period active + POST generate evaluations. Added `fetchApi` helper for authenticated mutations.
- `app/dean/dashboard/page.tsx` — Fixed "Create One" button route: `/dean/academic` → `/dean/evaluation-setup`.

**Gotchas for other agents:**
- Auth token key is `sessionStorage.getItem('auth_token')`, NOT `'token'`.
- The `courses` table uses `teacher_id` (not `instructor_id`). The API response includes both as `teacher_id` and `instructor_id` for compatibility.
- Courses now have `course_program` (ENUM: BSIT/BSEMC) and `year_level` (INT) fields.

### copilot — 2026-03-18
**To**: All
**Topic**: Database Tooling Update

**New Features:**
- `tools/create-admin.js` — Script to seed a default admin account (`admin@cite.edu` / `admin`).
- `package.json` — Added `npm run db:admin` command.

**Usage:**
- Run `npm run db:admin` to create the admin user if it doesn't exist.
- Password is stored in **plain text** (as requested).

### copilot — 2026-03-17
**To**: All
**Topic**: Slice 1 Clean-up & Slice 2 (Student Flow) Complete

**Slice 1 Fixes:**
- `app/dean/evaluation-setup/page.tsx`: Removed misplaced "Anonymous Student Feedback" section (copy-paste error) and unused handler functions. Verified syntax.

**Database Schema Update:**
- `database/schema.sql`: Changed `evaluation_responses.criteria_id` from `INT` to `VARCHAR(36)` and removed FK constraint to `evaluation_criteria`. This was necessary because evaluation forms now use JSON-based criteria with UUIDs.
- Ran migration script to apply this change to the local DB.

**Slice 2 (Student Flow):**
- `app/student/evaluations/page.tsx`:
  - Implemented fetching of active evaluation period and linked form.
  - Added dynamic form rendering based on the JSON form definition (supports criteria sections + questions).
  - Implemented submission logic using the new schema structure.
- `app/student/dashboard/page.tsx`:
  - Updated to fetch live data from `/evaluations` and `/evaluation_periods`.
  - Replaced dummy analytics with real pending/completed counts.
  - Fixed "Start Evaluation" links.
- `app/student/history/page.tsx`:
  - Updated to display submitted evaluations correctly.
  - Fixed status check (`status === 'locked'` instead of `isLocked`).
- `app/student/profile/page.tsx`:
  - Replaced `<Avatar>` component with a simple initial display (m1).

**API Updates:**
- `app/api/evaluation_periods/route.ts`: Allowed authenticated users (students/teachers) to fetch active periods.
- `app/api/forms/route.ts`: Allowed authenticated users to fetch a specific form by ID.

**Note:**
- `evaluation_responses` table now expects `criteria_id` as a string (UUID). If any other part of the system tries to insert INT, it will work (as string), but be aware of the type change.

### claude-opus — 2026-03-18
**To**: All
**Topic**: Slice 3 (Teacher Feedback & Peer Flow) Complete

**API Changes:**
- `app/api/evaluations/route.ts` — Added `role=evaluatee` query param support for non-dean users. When `?role=evaluatee` is passed, returns evaluations where the user is the evaluatee (received evaluations). Also added `evaluator_id`, `submitted_at`, `created_at`, `evaluatee_department` to the SELECT.

**Slice 3 (Teacher Flow):**
- `app/teacher/dashboard/page.tsx` — Added anonymous student feedback card fetching from `/api/comments?entity_type=evaluation&entity_id={teacherId}`. Added received evaluations fetch via `/api/evaluations?role=evaluatee` for accurate stats (overall rating, satisfaction distribution). Added quick action links to Peer Evaluation and Results pages.
- `app/teacher/peer/page.tsx` — Added `evaluateeId` to PeerEvaluation interface and mapping. On successful peer evaluation submission, now also POSTs an anonymous comment to `/api/comments` for the evaluatee's feedback dashboard.
- `app/student/evaluations/page.tsx` — Added anonymous comment POST to `/api/comments` on successful student evaluation submission, so teachers receive feedback on their dashboard. Added `evaluatee_id` to Evaluation interface.

**Gotchas for other agents:**
- Teacher dashboard now fetches TWO additional endpoints on mount: `/api/comments` and `/api/evaluations?role=evaluatee`.
- Anonymous feedback flows: student submits eval → comment POSTed to `/api/comments` with `entity_type='evaluation'`, `entity_id=teacherId`. Same for peer evaluations.
- The evaluations API now supports `?role=evaluatee` to return evaluations where the user is being evaluated (useful for viewing received scores).

### claude-opus — 2026-03-18 (Eval Setup Overhaul)
**To**: All
**Topic**: Evaluation Setup overhaul + new Evaluation Forms page

**Schema:**
- `database/schema.sql` — Added `draft` to `evaluation_periods.status` enum. Added `academic_year`, `semester`, `assignments_json` columns.

**API:**
- `app/api/evaluation_periods/route.ts` — POST now accepts and stores `academic_year`, `semester`, `assignments_json` fields for draft persistence.

**New Page:**
- `app/dean/forms/page.tsx` — Full Evaluation Forms CRUD page. List view with edit/delete, editor with inline criteria management (name, weight, questions). Validates total weight = 100%. Uses existing `/api/forms` endpoints.

**Evaluation Setup Rewrite:**
- `app/dean/evaluation-setup/page.tsx` — Major overhaul:
  - Subjects now load from `data/curriculum.ts` instead of the courses API (dynamic by program + year + semester)
  - Removed redundant semester dropdown in Section 2 — semester from Section 1 drives subject loading
  - Per-subject instructor dropdown (each subject gets its own instructor) + "Assign All" bulk action
  - Removed inline criteria section — replaced with form picker (dropdown of saved forms from `/api/forms`)
  - Read-only form preview when a form is selected
  - Semi-automatic evaluation name: `{prefix} — {AY} {Semester} ({date range})`
  - Draft management: fetches existing drafts, resume/delete buttons, saves setup as draft with `assignments_json`
  - Start Evaluation: validates all fields, auto-saves if needed, activates period, generates bulk assignments

**Gotchas:**
- `evaluation_periods` now uses `draft` status (not `upcoming`) for draft saves. The ENUM was updated in schema.sql but the live DB may need `ALTER TABLE evaluation_periods MODIFY COLUMN status ENUM('draft','upcoming','active','closed') DEFAULT 'upcoming';`.
- `assignments_json` stores `{program, yearLevel, section, assignments: {subjectCode: instructorId}}` as LONGTEXT JSON.

### gpt-5.1 — 2026-03-18
**To**: All
**Topic**: Teacher portal placeholder cleanup

- `app/teacher/classes/page.tsx` — Removed hardcoded sample stats, schedule, roster, and fake downloads. Kept layout but now only uses live course data where available (student counts) and neutral placeholders for future analytics.
- `app/teacher/dashboard/page.tsx` — Removed fallback teaching-load estimate; total students now derive only from real course enrollment fields.
- `app/teacher/results/page.tsx` — Removed hardcoded per-course student fallback (`35`); totals now use only real enrollment data.

### copilot — 2026-03-18
**To**: All
**Topic**: Student Self-Enrollment Feature Planning

**Plan**:
- **Objective**: Allow students to select Year Level and Section to auto-enroll in block subjects.
- **Schema**: Added `year_level` (INT) and `section` (VARCHAR) to `users` table.
- **Next Steps**: Implement API for profile update + auto-enrollment logic. Update Student Profile UI.
- **Note**: "Irregular" students will initially use this to set their primary block. Future iterations may allow granular subject selection.

### antigravity — 2026-03-20
**To**: All
**Topic**: Removed AI Coach Feature

- `app/teacher/layout.tsx`: Removed the AI Coach navigation tab.
- `app/teacher/ai-coach/`: Deleted the directory and the feature entirely as requested by the user.

### antigravity — 2026-03-20
**To**: All
**Topic**: Dean Dashboard Cleanups

- `app/dean/reports/page.tsx`: Converted report downloads from a faux PDF envelope to true native CSV files by implementing `generateCSVReport`, saving as `.csv`.
- `app/dean/reports/page.tsx`: Removed the "Compliance Report", "Criteria Analysis", and "Custom Report" sections and logic from the view.
- `app/dean/reports/page.tsx`: Removed the unused date picker filter component.
- `app/dean/audit/page.tsx`: Removed the "Export Logs" button and its unneeded file generation handler function.
- `app/teacher/dashboard/page.tsx`: Removed the "Download CSV" button and its report export logic.
- `app/teacher/peer/page.tsx`: Removed the "Export History" button and its respective csv download logic.
- `app/teacher/results/page.tsx`: Removed the "Export & Download Results" section and its `downloadReport` handler.

### antigravity — 2026-03-20
**To**: All
**Topic**: Theme Application

- `app/globals.css`: Updated the core system background (`body`) to use the global pastel purple-to-white gradient theme (`bg-gradient-to-r from-[#e4c4f9] to-[#fcfaff]`) as requested across all pages. Includes a corresponding dark mode aesthetic (`dark:from-[#2d1b42] dark:to-[#110a1a]`).

## Coding Standards

Guidelines — not rigid rules. Use judgment and log deviations.

### API Usage
- Use `useFetch` from `@/hooks` for GET requests (auto-attaches JWT)
- For POST/PATCH/DELETE, use `fetch()` with the token from `sessionStorage.getItem('auth_token')`
- API base URL pattern: `useFetch` prepends `/api` automatically, so pass paths like `'/users'` not `'/api/users'`

### Authentication Pattern
```typescript
// Standard fetch for mutations
const base = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || '/api';
const token = sessionStorage.getItem('auth_token');
const res = await fetch(`${base}/endpoint`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(payload),
});
const data = await res.json();
if (!data.success) throw new Error(data.error);
```

### Database
- All DB access goes through API routes, never directly from page components
- `cite_es.sql` is the source of truth for table definitions — keep `schema.sql` aligned with it

### Components
- Reuse existing components from `components/ui/` (Button, Card, Input, Select, Modal, Alert, Badge)
- If you need a new component, create it in `components/` and log it here

### Types
- Define page-specific types in the page file itself (existing pattern)
- If a type is shared across slices, create it in `types/` and log it here

### Error Handling
- Show user-facing errors via the `<Alert>` component
- API errors: catch and display `error.message` or the API response `error` field
- Don't swallow errors silently

## Key Data Relationships

```
evaluation_periods (admin creates)
  └─ form_id → evaluation_forms (criteria JSON)

evaluation_forms.criteria → JSON array of { name, weight, questions[] }

evaluations (generated on "Start Evaluation")
  ├─ evaluator_id → users.id (student/teacher doing the eval)
  ├─ evaluatee_id → users.id (teacher being evaluated)
  ├─ course_id → courses.id
  └─ evaluation_type: 'teacher' | 'peer' | 'dean'

courses (aligned with cite_es.sql)
  ├─ teacher_id → users.id
  ├─ course_program: ENUM('BSIT','BSEMC')
  └─ year_level: INT

evaluation_responses
  ├─ evaluation_id → evaluations.id
  └─ criteria_id → evaluation_criteria.id

comments (anonymous feedback)
  ├─ entity_type: 'evaluation'
  ├─ entity_id: evaluatee's user ID
  └─ author_id: hidden from display (anonymity)
```
